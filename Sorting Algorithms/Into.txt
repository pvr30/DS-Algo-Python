----- Sorting Algorithms

What is Sorting ?
---- Sorting Refers to Arranging data in particular format: either
ascending or descending.

- Types of sorting
-- Sorting
     - Space Used
        - In place
        - Out Of Place
     - Stability
        - Stable
        - UnStable


* Space Used
 -- In Place Sorting:- Sorting algo which does not require any
 extra space for sorting
 example :- Bubble Sort

 -- Out Place Sorting :- Sorting algo which require
 extra space for sorting.
 example :- Merge Sort




* Stability
 -- Stable :- If sorting algo after sorting the contents does not
 change the sequence of similar content in which they appear, then this
 sorting is called Stable Sorting
 example : - Insertion Sort

 -- Unstable:-If sorting algo after sorting the contents
 change the sequence of similar content in which they appear, then this
 sorting is called Unstable Sorting
 example :- Quick Sort


$$$ Sorting Terminology

-- Increasing Order
    - If Successive element is greater than the previous one
    - Example: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11

-- Decreasing Order
    - If Successive element is less than the previous one
    - Example: 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1

-- Non-Increasing Order
    - If Successive Element is less than or equal to its previous
        element in sequence
    - Example :- 11, 9, 7, 5, 5, 3, 1

-- Non-Decreasing Order
    - If Successive Element is greater than or equal to its previous
        element in sequence
    - Example:- 1, 3, 5, 7, 7, 9, 11
