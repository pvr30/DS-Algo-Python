What is Graph ?
-- "Graph Consists of finite set of Vertices(or Nodes) and set of edges which connect a pair of nodes"

Why Graphs ?
-- Graphs are a powerful and versatile data structure that easily allow you to represent real 
   life relationships between different types of data (nodes)


------ Graph Termonology ---------

  - Vertices:- nodes of the graph
  - Edge:- It a line that connect a pair of a Vertices
  - Unweighted Graph:- A graph which does not have a weight associated with any edge
  - Weighted Graph:- a graph which has a weight associated with any edge
  - Undirect Graph:- In case the edges of the graph do not have a direction associated with them
  - Directed Graph:- If the edges in a graph have a direction associated with them
  - Cyclic Graph:- A graph which has atleast one loop
  - Acyclic Graph:- a graph with no loop
  - Tree: It is a special case of directed acyclic graph.
