--- What is LinkedList ?
    - "LinkedList is a form of sequential collection and 
        it does have to be order. A linkdelist is made up 
        of independent nodes that may contain any type of data
        and each node has a reference to the next node 
        in the link."

-- LinkedList vs Arrays
    - elements of linkdelist are independent objects
    - variable size - the size of linkdelist is not predefined
    - insertion and removals in linkdelist are very efficient
    - accessing an element in array is very efficient in Arrays
