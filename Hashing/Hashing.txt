--- Hashing

- " Hashing is a method of sorting and indexing data. The idea behind hashing is allow large amounts of data to be 
indexed using keys."

-- Why we need Hashing ?
    - to reduce time complexity for searching

    - Time complexity for search
            1. Linear :- O(N)
            2. Binary :- O(logN)
            3. Hashing :- O(1)

-- Hashing Terminology
  - Hash Function :- It is a function that can be used to map of arbitary size to data of fixed size.
  - Key :- Input data by user
  - Hash value :- A value that is return by a hash function
  - Hash Table :- It is a data structure which implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that
                  can map keys to values
  - Collision :- A Collision occurs when two different keys to a hash function produce the same output.


------------ Hash Function ----------------

    1. Mod Function :- It helps to reduce space

        h(x) = x % (totol no. of cells in hash Table)

        Let's say h(8) = 8 % 10 = 8,
                  h(15) = 15 % 10 = 5

    2. Ascii Function :- For string

        def modASCII(string, cellnumber):
            total = 0
            for i in string:
                total += ord(i)
            return total % cellnumber


-- Properties of good hash function
    - It distribute hash values uniformly across hash tables
    - It has to use all the input data
