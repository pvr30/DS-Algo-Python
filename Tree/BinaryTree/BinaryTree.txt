Binary Tree: "Binary tree are the data structure in which each node has at most
two children often reffred to as the left and right children"

"""


 -- We can use LinkedList and Python List to represent Binary Tree.


 --- Using Linked List
   - Every Node has three value
    - first data block
    - left Child location
    - right Child location

--- Using Python List
    - 0 index should not be considered
    - Left Child = cell[2x]  where x = index
    - Right Child = cell[2x + 1]
