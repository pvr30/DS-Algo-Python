-----  AVL Tree ---


--- What is AVL Tree ?

    - "An AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree where the differece between heights of left subtree
    and right subtree can not be more than one for all nodes"

-- If at any time heights of left and right subtrees differ by more than one, than rebalancing is done to restore
    AVL property, this process is called rotation


---- Why AVL Tree

- let's say we want to insert 10,20,30,40,50

-- so using BST it looks like this and time complexity for searching is O(N)
        10
          \
           20
             \
              30
                \
                 40
                   \
                    50

--- But.........

- Using AVL Tree and time complexity is O(logN)

        40
       /  \
      20   50
     /  \
    10   30
