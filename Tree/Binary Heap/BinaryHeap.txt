--- Binary Heap----

""
A binary heap is either Min Heap or Max Heap. In a Min binary heap. the key at root must be minimum among all keys
present in binary heap. the same property must be recursively true for all nodes in binary tree

""

--- It is a complete tree, all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the 
last level has all keys as left as possible. this property make them suitable to be stored in an array.


--- Max Heap :- the value of each node is greater than equal to the value of both its children

--- Min Heap:- the value of each node is less than equal to the value of both its children
