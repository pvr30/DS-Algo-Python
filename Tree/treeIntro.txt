------ Tree -----
"A tree is a nonlinear datastructure with hierarchical relationship
between its elements without having any cycle. it is basically 
reversed from real life tree"


-- Properties Of Tree
    - represent hierarchical data
    - each node has two component: data and a link to its subcategory
    - base category and subcategory under it


-- Why Tree ?
   - Quicker and easier access to data
   - store hierarchical data like folder structure, organized structure,



--- Tree Termonology
     - Root: top node without parent
     - Edge: a link between parent and child
     - Leaf: a node which does not have children
     - Sibling: children of same parent
     - Ancestor: a node which has parent, grandparent and great grandparent 
     - Depth of node: a length of the path from root to node
     - Height of node: a length of the path from the node to the deepest node
     - Depth of tree: depth of root node = 0
     - Height of tree: height of root node
